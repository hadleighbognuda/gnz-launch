### Description 
I want to design an ios app that is used for registering flight details for a tow plane that tows gliders, I need a field for the tow plane registration id, the tow plane pilot name, the registration of the glider and up to two pilots of the glider, identified by a 4 digit numeric pilot id. One of which is the primary pilot for billing. 
The user interface needs to be very clear and simple for aged it challenged users.
We need to be able to build and run this using docker, using WSL in a windows environment.
